Implement the following plan:

# Verify CI fix: local fresh-environment test for libfzf.so

## Context

Changes to `devenv.nix` and `run_tests.sh` are already applied. Need to verify they work in a fresh environment that mirrors CI. CI runs `make neovim-test-dev` (`.github/workflows/lua.yml:36`), which executes:

```
DEVENV_ROOT=. nix develop .# --command make neovim-test
```

This enters the devenv shell (only packages from `devenv.nix`) and runs `run_tests.sh`. The pre-build step in `run_tests.sh` should detect missing `libfzf.so` and compile it using `gnumake`/`gcc` from `devenv.nix`.

## Verification steps

### 1. Delete `libfzf.so` to simulate fresh CI

```bash
rm ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/core/opt/telescope-fzf-native.nvim/build/libfzf.so
```

### 2. Run `make neovim-test-dev` (mirrors CI exactly)

```bash
make neovim-test-dev
```

**Expected**: The `run_tests.sh` output shows `Building telescope-fzf-native.nvim...` followed by all tests passing.

### 3. Confirm `libfzf.so` was rebuilt

```bash
ls -la ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/core/opt/telescope-fzf-native.nvim/build/libfzf.so
```

### 4. Run again to confirm idempotency

```bash
make neovim-test-dev
```

**Expected**: No "Building..." message (already exists), tests still pass.

If this plan can be broken down into multiple independent tasks, consider using the TeamCreate tool to create a team and parallelize the work.
