          "text": "WorktreeCreate\nWhen you run claude --worktree or a subagent uses isolation: \"worktree\", Claude Code creates an isolated working copy using git worktree. If you configure a WorktreeCreate hook, it replaces the default git behavior, letting you use a different version control system like SVN, Perforce, or Mercurial.\nThe hook must print the absolute path to the created worktree directory on stdout. Claude Code uses this path as the working directory for the isolated session.\nThis example creates an SVN working copy and prints the path for Claude Code to use. Replace the repository URL with your own:\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"WorktreeCreate\": [\n      {\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bash -c 'NAME=$(jq -r .name); DIR=\\\"$HOME/.claude/worktrees/$NAME\\\"; svn checkout https://svn.example.com/repo/trunk \\\"$DIR\\\" >&2 && echo \\\"$DIR\\\"'\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\nThe hook reads the worktree name from the JSON input on stdin, checks out a fresh copy into a new directory, and prints the directory path. The echo on the last line is what Claude Code reads as the worktree path. Redirect any other output to stderr so it doesn’t interfere with the path.\n​\nWorktreeCreate input\nIn addition to the common input fields, WorktreeCreate hooks receive the name field. This is a slug identifier for the new worktree, either specified by the user or auto-generated (for example, bold-oak-a3f2).\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl\",\n  \"cwd\": \"/Users/...\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"WorktreeCreate\",\n  \"name\": \"feature-auth\"\n}\n​\nWorktreeCreate output\nThe hook must print the absolute path to the created worktree directory on stdout. If the hook fails or produces no output, worktree creation fails with an error.\nWorktreeCreate hooks do not use the standard allow/block decision model. Instead, the hook’s success or failure determines the outcome. Only type: \"command\" hooks are supported.\n​\nWorktreeRemove\nThe cleanup counterpart to WorktreeCreate. This hook fires when a worktree is being removed, either when you exit a --worktree session and choose to remove it, or when a subagent with isolation: \"worktree\" finishes. For git-based worktrees, Claude handles cleanup automatically with git worktree remove. If you configured a WorktreeCreate hook for a non-git version control system, pair it with a WorktreeRemove hook to handle cleanup. Without one, the worktree directory is left on disk.\nClaude Code passes the path that WorktreeCreate printed on stdout as worktree_path in the hook input. This example reads that path and removes the directory:\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"WorktreeRemove\": [\n      {\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bash -c 'jq -r .worktree_path | xargs rm -rf'\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n​\nWorktreeRemove input\nIn addition to the common input fields, WorktreeRemove hooks receive the worktree_path field, which is the absolute path to the worktree being removed.\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl\",\n  \"cwd\": \"/Users/...\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"WorktreeRemove\",\n  \"worktree_path\": \"/Users/.../my-project/.claude/worktrees/feature-auth\"\n}\nWorktreeRemove hooks have no decision control. They cannot block worktree removal but can perform cleanup tasks like removing version control state or archiving changes. Hook failures are logged in debug mode only. Only type: \"command\" hooks are supported.\n​\n how to make this play it nicely w/ the worktree",

For configuration, follow the workflows below.\n\n## Two Types of Configuration\n\nWorktrunk uses two separate config files with different scopes and behaviors:\n\n### User Config (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`)\n- **Scope**: Personal preferences for the individual developer\n- **Location**: `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` (never checked into git)\n- **Contains**: LLM integration, worktree path templates, command settings, user hooks, approved commands\n- **Permission model**: Always propose changes and get consent before editing\n- **See**: `reference/config.md` for detailed guidance\n\n### Project Config (`.config/wt.toml`)\n- **Scope**: Team-wide automation shared by all developers\n- **Location**: `<repo>/.config/wt.toml` (checked into git)\n- **Contains**: Hooks for worktree lifecycle (post-create, pre-merge, etc.)\n- **Permission model**: Proactive (create directly, changes are reversible via git)\n- **See**: `reference/hook.md` for detailed guidance\n\n## Determining Which Config to Use\n\nWhen a user asks for configuration help, determine which type based on:\n\n**User config indicators**:\n- \"set up LLM\" or \"configure commit generation\"\n- \"change where worktrees are created\"\n- \"customize commit message templates\"\n- Affects only their environment\n\n**Project config indicators**:\n- \"set up hooks for this project\"\n- \"automate npm install\"\n- \"run tests before merge\"\n- Affects the entire team\n\n**Both configs may be needed**: For example, setting up LLM integration requires user config, but automating quality checks requires project config.\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### Setting Up LLM Integration (User Config)\n\nMost common request. Follow this sequence:\n\n1. **Check if LLM tool exists**\n   ```bash\n   which llm  # or: which aichat\n   ```\n\n2. **If not installed, guide installation (don't run it)**\n   ```bash\n   uv tool install -U llm\n   ```\n\n3. **Guide API key setup (don't run it)**\n   ```bash\n   llm install llm-anthropic\n   llm keys set anthropic\n   llm models default claude-haiku-4.5\n   ```\n\n4. **Propose config change**\n   ```toml\n   [commit-generation]\n   command = \"llm\"\n   ```\n   Ask: \"Should I add this to your config?\"\n\n5. **After approval, apply**\n   - Check if config exists: `wt config show`\n   - If not, guide through `wt config create`\n   - Read, modify, write preserving structure\n\n6. **Suggest testing**\n   ```bash\n   llm \"say hello\"\n   wt merge  # in a repo with uncommitted changes\n   ```\n\n**See `reference/config.md` and `reference/llm-commits.md` for complete details.**\n\n### Setting Up Project Hooks (Project Config)\n\nCommon request for workflow automation. Follow discovery process:\n\n1. **Detect project type**\n   ```bash\n   ls package.json Cargo.toml pyproject.toml\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify available commands**\n   - For npm: Read `package.json` scripts\n   - For Rust: Common cargo commands\n   - For Python: Check pyproject.toml\n\n3. **Design appropriate hooks** (7 hook types available)\n   - Dependencies (fast, must complete) → `post-create`\n   - Tests/linting (must pass) → `pre-commit` or `pre-merge`\n   - Long builds, dev servers → `post-start`\n   - Terminal/IDE updates → `post-switch`\n   - Deployment → `post-merge`\n   - Cleanup tasks → `pre-remove`\n\n4. **Validate commands work**\n   ```bash\n   npm run lint  # verify exists\n   which cargo   # verify tool exists\n   ```\n\n5. **Create `.config/wt.toml`**\n   ```toml\n   # Install dependencies when creating worktrees\n   post-create = \"npm install\"\n\n   # Validate code quality before committing\n   [pre-commit]\n   lint = \"npm run lint\"\n   typecheck = \"npm run typecheck\"\n\n   # Run tests before merging\n   pre-merge = \"npm test\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Add comments explaining choices**\n\n7. **Suggest testing**\n   ```bash\n   wt switch --create test-hooks\n   ```\n\n**See `reference/hook.md` for complete details.**\n\n### Adding Hooks to Existing Config\n\nWhen users want to add automation to an existing project:\n\n1. **Read existing config**: `cat .config/wt.toml`\n\n2. **Determine hook type** - When should this run?\n   - Creating worktree (blocking) → `post-create`\n   - Creating worktree (background) → `post-start`\n   - Every switch → `post-switch`\n   - Before committing → `pre-commit`\n   - Before merging → `pre-merge`\n   - After merging → `post-merge`\n   - Before removal → `pre-remove`\n\n3. **Handle format conversion if needed**\n\n   Single command to named table:\n   ```toml\n   # Before\n   post-create = \"npm install\"\n\n   # After (adding db:migrate)\n   [post-create]\n   install = \"npm install\"\n   migrate = \"npm run db:migrate\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Preserve existing structure and comments**\n\n### Validation Before Adding Commands\n\nBefore adding hooks, validate:\n\n```bash\n# Verify command exists\nwhich npm\nwhich cargo\n\n# For npm, verify script exists\nnpm run lint --dry-run\n\n# For shell commands, check syntax\nbash -n -c \"if [ true ]; then echo ok; fi\"\n```\n\n**Dangerous patterns** — Warn users before creating hooks with:\n- Destructive commands: `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`\n- External dependencies: `curl http://...`\n- Privilege escalation: `sudo`\n\n## Permission Models\n\n### User Config: Conservative\n- **Never edit without consent** - Always show proposed change and wait for approval\n- **Never install tools** - Provide commands for users to run themselves\n- **Preserve structure** - Keep existing comments and organization\n- **Validate first** - Ensure TOML is valid before writing\n\n### Project Config: Proactive\n- **Create directly** - Changes are versioned, easily reversible\n- **Validate commands** - Check commands exist before adding\n- **Explain choices** - Add comments documenting why hooks exist\n- **Warn on danger** - Flag destructive operations before adding\n\n## Common Tasks Reference\n\n### User Config Tasks\n- Set up LLM integration → `reference/llm-commits.md`\n- Customize worktree paths → `reference/config.md#worktree-path-template`\n- Custom commit templates → `reference/llm-commits.md#templates`\n- Configure command defaults → `reference/config.md#command-settings`\n- Set up personal hooks → `reference/config.md#user-hooks`\n\n### Project Config Tasks\n- Set up hooks for new project → `reference/hook.md`\n- Add hook to existing config → `reference/hook.md#configuration`\n- Use template variables → `reference/hook.md#template-variables`\n- Add dev server URL to list → `reference/config.md#dev-server-url`\n\n## Key Commands\n\n```bash\n# View all configuration\nwt config show\n\n# Create initial user config\nwt config create\n\n# LLM setup guide\nwt config --help\n```\n\n## Loading Additional Documentation\n\nLoad **reference files** for detailed configuration, hook specifications, and troubleshooting.\n\nFind specific sections with grep:\n```bash\ngrep -A 20 \"## Setup\" reference/llm-commits.md\ngrep -A 30 \"### post-create\" reference/hook.md\ngrep -A 20 \"## Warning Messages\" reference/shell-integration.md\n```\n\n## Advanced: Agent Handoffs\n\nWhen the user requests spawning a worktree with Claude in a background session (\"spawn a worktree for...\", \"hand off to another agent\"), use the appropriate pattern for their terminal multiplexer:\n\n**tmux** (check `$TMUX` env var):\n```bash\ntmux new-session -d -s <branch-name> \"wt switch --create <branch-name> -x claude -- '<task description>'\"\n```\n\n**Zellij** (check `$ZELLIJ` env var):\n```bash\nzellij run -- wt switch --create <branch-name> -x claude -- '<task description>'\n```\n\n**Requirements** (all must be true):\n- User explicitly requests spawning/handoff\n- User is in a supported multiplexer (tmux or Zellij)\n- User's CLAUDE.md or explicit instruction authorizes this pattern\n\n**Do not use this pattern** for normal worktree operations.\n\nExample (tmux):\n```bash\ntmux new-session -d -s fix-auth-bug \"wt switch --create fix-auth-bug -x claude -- \\\n  'The login session expires after 5 minutes. Find the session timeout config and extend it to 24 hours.'\"\n```\n\nExample (Zellij):\n```bash\nzellij run -- wt switch --create fix-auth-bug -x claude -- \\\n  'The login session expires after 5 minutes. Find the session timeout config and extend it to 24 hours.'\n```\n",

But the key feature the user is asking about is worktrunk's file copying - when it creates a worktree, it copies over untracked/ignored files that are needed (like `node_modules`, `.env`, build artifacts, etc.).\n\nLet me check worktrunk's documentation on this. The `wt switch --create` command should handle all of that natively. The `--no-cd` flag just prevents it from changing the shell's directory (since we need the hook to return the path, not actually cd into it).\n \nI'm realizing I need to verify whether `wt switch --create` with `--no-cd` still performs the full worktree setup including file copying, and whether worktrunk's file copying is a built-in feature or something configured through post-create hooks. Let me check the worktrunk documentation more carefully. Since we're calling the full `wt switch --create` command, worktrunk handles everything natively—file copying, post-create hooks, all of it. The user just needs to configure their `.config/wt.toml` with the appropriate copy rules or post-create hooks for their projects.",

Spawns `post-start` hooks (background)\n\nThe `--no-cd` flag only skips the shell directory change — everything else runs normally.\n\nFor the file copying to work per-project, you'd configure it in each repo's `.config/wt.toml`, e.g.:\n\n```toml\npost-create = \"cp ../.env .env\"\n```\n\nOr if worktrunk has a built-in copy directive in user config, that'll also fire.
