how to see git notes

---

can you list all refs/notes/commits

---

why? git-ai is supposed to push to main

---

hmm yea pleaes check why it's not pushing

---

yea let's chain the hooks

---

nah; keep the cargo git-ai

---

ah; so it will still work w/ the git-ai binary being in .cargo/bin?'

---

no; the git-ai needs to be called from ~/.cargo/bin/git-ai make it work as is
