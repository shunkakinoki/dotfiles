how to see git notes

---

can you list all refs/notes/commits

---

why? git-ai is supposed to push to main

---

hmm yea pleaes check why it's not pushing

---

yea let's chain the hooks

---

nah; keep the cargo git-ai

---

ah; so it will still work w/ the git-ai binary being in .cargo/bin?'

---

no; the git-ai needs to be called from ~/.cargo/bin/git-ai make it work as is

---

confirm it's now working

# /pr-create — Create pull requests

Create GitHub PRs with proper formatting, labeling, and quality checks.

## Quick Workflow

```bash
# 1. Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature"

# 2. Push branch
git push -u origin feature-branch

# 3. Create PR
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add feature" \
  --body "## Changes
- Added feature X

## Testing
- All checks pass

Generated with [AI_TOOL] by [AI_MODEL]" \
  --base main
```

## Variant: `/pr-create auto`

Enable auto-merge after creation:

```bash
gh pr merge $(gh pr view --json number -q '.number') --squash --auto
```

## PR Description Template

```markdown
## Changes
- What was modified

## Technical Details
- Implementation specifics

## Testing
- Verification steps

Generated with [AI_TOOL] by [AI_MODEL]
```

## Labeling

```bash
gh pr edit <number> --add-label enhancement  # feat:
gh pr edit <number> --add-label bug          # fix:
gh pr edit <number> --add-label documentation # docs:
```

## Guidelines

- Conventional commit title format
- Under 72 characters
- Solo-authored commits (no co-authorship)
- AI attribution in PR body only
- Generate changeset via `/changesets` if applicable
- Run quality checks before creating
