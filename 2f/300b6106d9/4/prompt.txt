Implement the following plan:

# Fix CI: build libfzf.so in test environment

## Context

`telescope.load_extension("fzf")` (without `pcall`) fails in CI because `libfzf.so` isn't compiled there. The plugin is downloaded by `vim.pack.add()` (`plugins.lua:38`, `build = "make"`), but the devenv shell (`devenv.nix`) lacks `gcc`/`make` so the native build silently fails. The home-manager activation script (`default.nix:50-63`) handles this in production but doesn't run in CI.

## Changes

### 1. Add build tools to `devenv.nix`

Add `pkgs.gnumake` and `pkgs.gcc` to `packages` so `vim.pack`'s `build = "make"` can compile native extensions in CI.

### 2. Add pre-build step to `run_tests.sh`

Before running tests, find `telescope-fzf-native.nvim` in nvim's pack directory and run `make` if `libfzf.so` is missing — mirrors the activation script logic. This ensures the `.so` exists even if `vim.pack` skips the build on subsequent runs.

```bash
# Build telescope-fzf-native if libfzf.so is missing
PACK_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/nvim/site/pack"
for d in "$PACK_DIR"/*/opt/telescope-fzf-native.nvim "$PACK_DIR"/*/start/telescope-fzf-native.nvim; do
  if [ -d "$d" ] && [ ! -f "$d/build/libfzf.so" ]; then
    echo "Building telescope-fzf-native.nvim..."
    make -C "$d" clean all
  fi
done
```

## Files

- `devenv.nix` — add `pkgs.gnumake`, `pkgs.gcc`
- `home-manager/programs/neovim/run_tests.sh` — add libfzf.so build step

## Verification

- `make neovim-test` passes locally
- `make neovim-test-dev` passes locally (nix dev shell)
- CI `lua-neovim-test` job passes

how to test locally fresh to confirm that works on ci
