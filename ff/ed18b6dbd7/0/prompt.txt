Implement the following plan:

# Fix telescope-fzf-native.nvim: Declarative Build + E2E Test

## Context

`telescope-fzf-native.nvim` requires a compiled native library (`libfzf.so`/`libfzf.dylib`). The plugin spec has `build = "make"` but `vim.pack`'s build step didn't execute (or failed silently), leaving the `build/` directory missing. This causes `telescope.load_extension("fzf")` to error on nvim startup.

The user wants a **declarative** fix (via Nix/home-manager) rather than a manual `make` command, plus an **e2e test** to catch these errors in CI.

## Changes

### 1. Add home-manager activation script to build native plugins
**File**: `home-manager/programs/neovim/default.nix`

Add a `home.activation.buildNvimNativePlugins` step that runs after `writeBoundary`. It will:
- Check if `telescope-fzf-native.nvim` exists in the pack directory
- Run `make` if `build/libfzf.{so,dylib}` is missing
- Use `pkgs.gnumake` and `pkgs.gcc` (or `pkgs.clang` on Darwin) to ensure build tools are available

This runs automatically on every `home-manager switch` / `make switch`.

### 2. Add pcall guard to telescope fzf extension loading
**File**: `home-manager/programs/neovim/lua/config/telescope.lua`

Wrap `telescope.load_extension("fzf")` in `pcall` so a missing native library doesn't crash nvim startup. This is defense-in-depth — the activation script is the primary fix.

### 3. Add e2e init.lua loading test
**File**: `home-manager/programs/neovim/tests/plugins_spec.lua`

Add a test that verifies the full `init.lua` can be loaded headlessly without Lua errors. This catches the exact class of error from the bug report.

### 4. Update CI workflow to run e2e config validation
**File**: `.github/workflows/lua.yml`

The existing `lua-neovim` job already runs `make lua-check-neovim-dev` which loads `init.lua` headlessly. The pcall guard (change #2) will prevent this from being a hard error on fresh CI installs where plugins aren't synced. The new test (change #3) will validate the pattern.

## Verification

1. Run `make switch` — activation script builds `libfzf.dylib`
2. Run `nvim` — no E5113 error
3. Run `make neovim-test` — new e2e test passes
4. Verify `ls ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/core/opt/telescope-fzf-native.nvim/build/` shows the compiled library

make build and switch

ok cool create PR but before tell me how to close file ideally i want it <space> + w like how u do for other apps

---

hmm it doesn't close the panel though

[Request interrupted by user]

space + ff returns E5108: Lua: /Users/shunkakinoki/.config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua:203: attempt to call field 'open' (a nil value)

ok.. also why is space + q not closing the buffer (there's two panels w/ 1 and 1)

ok make build and switch
