# xremap creates its own virtual keyboard device via uinput. By default, xremap
# uses vendor/product 0x1234/0x5678 for that output device.
#
# When keyd matches all keyboards via `*`, it can end up grabbing xremap's
# virtual device too, which may cause event feedback/loops and effectively kill
# input. Exclude the default xremap device id to prevent that.
