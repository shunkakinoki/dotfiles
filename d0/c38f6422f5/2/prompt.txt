Implement the following plan:

# Remove pcall guard from telescope fzf extension loading

## Context

The `pcall` around `telescope.load_extension("fzf")` was added as defense-in-depth, but the activation script now reliably builds `libfzf.so` on every `make switch`. The `pcall` silently swallows errors, which is worse — we'd never notice if fzf broke again.

## Change

**File**: `home-manager/programs/neovim/lua/config/telescope.lua` (line 43)

Revert `pcall(telescope.load_extension, "fzf")` back to `telescope.load_extension("fzf")`.

## Verification

- `make neovim-test` passes
- `nvim` starts without errors

If this plan can be broken down into multiple independent tasks, consider using the TeamCreate tool to create a team and parallelize the work.
